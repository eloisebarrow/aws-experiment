## Errors and Resolutions

**ERROR**: 1) User 1's image is no longer rendering although it was yesterday 11/6 - Network tab shows a 403 Forbidden error from AWS. 2) All newer user images loaded fine at first but within approximately 10 minutes they had the same error - URL from API displays an XML error: "This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below." & XML doc indicates Request Expired / Access Denied 3) Once I uploaded a new image, all images loaded fine again but then most recent image uploaded stopped working, followed by the rest, after 3 minutes.

**RESOLUTION**: TBD
